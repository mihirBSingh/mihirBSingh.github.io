For the perceptron algorithm, experiments were run to check how it performed on linearly separable data, non-linearly separable data, and data with more than 2 dimensions. Experiments with the minibatch perceptron algorithm first focused on its performance compared to the regular perceptron algorithm, its performance on data with multiple dimensions, and its ability to converge when looking at all the data in a single iteration. Through this process, I developed an understanding of the perceptron algorithm and how it can be improved upon with a minibatch algorithm.\n\n\n\n%load_ext autoreload\n%autoreload 2\nfrom perceptron import Perceptron, PerceptronOptimizer\nfrom perceptronMB import PerceptronMB, PerceptronOptimizerMB\n\nThe autoreload extension is already loaded.

We should first check if our perceptron probably works by running it on our minimal training loop. We know it works if our perceptron converges and we achieve a loss of 0.\n\nfrom perceptron import Perceptron, PerceptronOptimizer\n\n# instantiate a model and an optimizer\np = Perceptron() \nopt = PerceptronOptimizer(p)\n\nloss = 1.0\n\n# for keeping track of loss values\nloss_vec = []\n\nn = X.size()[0]\n\nwhile loss &gt; 0: # dangerous -- only terminates if data is linearly separable\n    # not part of the update: just for tracking our progress  \n    loss = p.loss(X, y) \n    loss_vec.append(loss)  \n    \n    # look at a single data point - consulted with Sophie Seiple to get single point  \n    i = torch.randint(n, size = (1,))\n    xi = X[[i],:]\n    yi = y[i]\n    \n    # perform a perceptron update using the random data point\n    opt.step(xi, yi)\n    \n    if(loss == 0):\n        print(loss)\n    \n\ntensor(0.)\n\n\nWe see that our tensor eventually becomes 0, so we are indeed converging on 0 and our perceptron is probably correct.\n\n\n\nNow we can experiment with our perceptron and look at when the data is linearly separable, not linearly separable, and look at how the perceptron works in 2 dimensions.\n\n\nWe can use the same data from the example above (since we know that the data is linearly separable) and visualize the process of a perceptron finding a line the separates the data.\n\n# Code below provided by Professor Phil Chodrow\n\nfrom matplotlib import pyplot as plt\nplt.style.use('seaborn-v0_8-whitegrid')\n\n# functions for plotting perceptron data\ndef draw_line(w, x_min, x_max, ax, **kwargs):\n    w_ = w.flatten()\n    x = torch.linspace(x_min, x_max, 101)\n    y = -(w_[0]*x + w_[2])/w_[1]\n    l = ax.plot(x, y, **kwargs)\n\ndef plot_perceptron_data(X, y, ax):\n    assert X.shape[1] == 3, \"This function only works for data created with p_dims == 2\"\n    targets = [-1, 1]\n    markers = [\"o\" , \",\"]\n    for i in range(2):\n        ix = y == targets[i]\n        ax.scatter(X[ix,0], X[ix,1], s = 20,  c = y[ix], facecolors = \"none\", edgecolors = \"darkgrey\", cmap = \"BrBG\", vmin = -2, vmax = 2, alpha = 0.5, marker = markers[i])\n    ax.set(xlabel = r\"$x_1$\", ylabel = r\"$x_2$\")\n\nJust to be sure, let’s look at the data first to confirm it looks linearly separable visually.\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 1)\nplot_perceptron_data(X,y, ax)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndeed, our data looks linearly separable. Now let’s run our perceptron.\n\n# Parts of code for visualization provided by Professor Phil Chodrow\ntorch.manual_seed(1234567)\n\n# initialize a perceptron \np = Perceptron()\nopt = PerceptronOptimizer(p)\np.loss(X, y)\n\n# initialize for main loop\ncurrent_ax = 0\nloss = 1\nloss_vec = []\n\n# set up the figure\nplt.rcParams[\"figure.figsize\"] = (7, 5)\nfig, axarr = plt.subplots(2, 3, sharex = True, sharey = True)\nmarkers = [\"o\", \",\"]\nmarker_map = {-1 : 0, 1 : 1}\n\n\nwhile loss &gt; 0:\n    # we are always still look at a single data point\n    i = torch.randint(n, size = (1,))\n    xi = X[[i],:]\n    yi = y[i]\n    \n    ax = axarr.ravel()[current_ax]\n    \n    # save the old value of w for plotting later\n    old_w = torch.clone(p.w)\n    \n    # make an optimization step -- this is where the update actually happens\n    # now p.w is the new value     \n    local_loss = opt.step(xi, yi)\n    loss = p.loss(X, y).item()\n    loss_vec.append(loss)\n    \n    # if a change was made, plot the old and new decision boundaries\n    # also add the new loss to loss_vec for plotting below\n    if local_loss &gt; 0:\n        plot_perceptron_data(X, y, ax)\n        draw_line(old_w, x_min = -1, x_max = 2, ax = ax, color = \"black\", linestyle = \"dashed\")\n        loss = p.loss(X, y).item()\n        loss_vec.append(loss)\n        draw_line(p.w, x_min = -1, x_max = 2, ax = ax, color = \"black\")\n        ax.scatter(X[i,0],X[i,1], color = \"black\", facecolors = \"none\", edgecolors = \"black\", marker = markers[marker_map[y[i].item()]])\n        # draw_line(w, -10, 10, ax, color = \"black\")\n        ax.set_title(f\"loss = {loss:.3f}\")\n        ax.set(xlim = (-1, 2), ylim = (-1, 2))\n        current_ax += 1\n        \nplt.tight_layout()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see that our perceptron becomes more accurate, converging on the correct answer. Another way to visualize our perceptron’s accuracy is through a loss graph.\n\n# Loss graph\ndef loss_graph(loss_vec):\n    plt.plot(loss_vec, marker='o', linestyle='-')\n    plt.title('Loss Graph: Experiment 1')\n    plt.xlabel('Step')\n    plt.ylabel('Loss')\n    plt.show()\n    print(\"final loss: \", loss_vec[len(loss_vec)-1])\n    \nloss_graph(loss_vec=loss_vec)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfinal loss:  0.0\n\n\nWe see that eventually (after may steps) we eventually do reach a loss of 0., but our loss graph shows the accuracy of the perceptron for every step over time.\nLet’s see what the decision boundary looks like on the final iteration.\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 1, figsize = (4, 4))\nax.set(xlim = (-1, 2), ylim = (-1, 2))\nplot_perceptron_data(X, y, ax)\ndraw_line(p.w, -1, 2, ax, color = \"black\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe see that on the final step, the perceptron settles on a line that accurately separated all the data.\n\n\n\nWe’ve looked at the perceptron’s accuracy when we know that the data is linearly separable. Now we can look at how a perceptron will perform when we know that the data is not linearly separable.\nTo do this, we first need to create data that we know is not linearly separable. We can use the same perceptron_data function from before, but we can instead set it so that the noise is higher. This has the effect of points from the different classes crossing each other’s boundaries and thus making the data not linearly separable.\n\nX, y = perceptron_data(noise=0.5)\ny_ = (y+1)/2\n\nLet’s also plot the training and testing data for a visual inspection.\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 1)\nplot_perceptron_data(X,y, ax)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we can visually see that out data is not perfectly linearly separable.\nLet’s begin training our perceptron. We will loop through for 1000 iterations. Let’s see what we come up with after 500 and then finally when we finish at 1000 iterations\n\n# Initialize perceptron\np = Perceptron()\nopt = PerceptronOptimizer(p)\np.loss(X, y)\n\nloss_vec = []\n\n# Training loop to 500\niterations = 0\nwhile iterations &lt; 500:\n    i = torch.randint(n, size = (1,))\n    xi = X[[i],:]\n    yi = y[i]\n    local_loss = opt.step(xi, yi)\n    loss = p.loss(X, y).item()\n    iterations += 1\n    loss_vec.append(loss)\n    \n# Plot perceptron after 500 iterations\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 1, figsize = (4, 4))\nax.set(xlim = (-1, 2), ylim = (-1, 2))\nplot_perceptron_data(X, y, ax)\ndraw_line(p.w, x_min = -1, x_max = 2, ax = ax, color = \"black\")\nprint(loss)\n\n0.1666666716337204\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is somewhat accurate, but it’s a stretch to say perfect like in experiment 1. Let’s go to 1000 iterations. For the final iteration, we will also plot the decision boundary of the perceptron before we stopped iterating.\n\n# Training loop to 1000\niterations = 0\nloss_vec = []\n\nwhile iterations &lt; 1000:\n    i = torch.randint(n, size = (1,))\n    xi = X[[i],:]\n    yi = y[i]\n    local_loss = opt.step(xi, yi)\n    loss = p.loss(X, y).item()\n    iterations += 1\n    loss_vec.append(loss)\n    \n# Plot perceptron after 500 iterations (with decision boundaries)\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 1, figsize = (4, 4))\nax.set(xlim = (-1, 2), ylim = (-1, 2))\nplot_perceptron_data(X, y, ax)\ndraw_line(p.w, x_min = -1, x_max = 2, ax = ax, color = \"black\")\nprint(\"loss:\", loss)\n\nloss: 0.1066666692495346\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe see here that our loss decreases slightly. Let’s take a look at the loss over time.\n\nprint(len(loss_vec))\nplt.plot(loss_vec, marker='o', linestyle='-')\nplt.title('Loss Graph: Experiment 2')\nplt.xlabel('Step')\nplt.ylabel('Loss')\nplt.show()\nprint(\"final loss: \", loss_vec[len(loss_vec)-1])\n\n1000\nfinal loss:  0.1066666692495346\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see that we can’t say the loss generally decreases and converges on an answer - like we could generalize in part 1.\n\n\n\nNow we will look at the perceptron algorithm working in more than two dimensions. To do this, we can run our perceptron algorithm on data with 5 features.\nFirst we need to generate perceptron data with 5 features. To do this we need to modify the perceptron_data function that we have been using. We’ll also make the noise 0.35 (which is just the average of the noises from the pervious experiments)\n\ndef multi_dim_perceptron_data(n_points = 300, noise = 0.35, dim=5):\n    \n    y = torch.arange(n_points) &gt;= int(n_points/2)\n    X = y[:, None] + torch.normal(0.0, noise, size = (n_points, dim))\n    X = torch.cat((X, torch.ones((X.shape[0], 1))), 1)\n\n    # convert y from {0, 1} to {-1, 1}\n    y = 2*y - 1\n\n    return X, y\n\nX, y = multi_dim_perceptron_data(dim=5)\n\nWe can look at the score of our perceptron over the training period to help us answer if the data is linearly separable. First we need to run our algorithm.\n\n# rerun perceptron for experiment 3\n# initialize a perceptron \np = Perceptron()\nopt = PerceptronOptimizer(p)\np.loss(X, y)\nloss = 1\nloss_vec = []\nscores = []\nwhile loss &gt; 0:\n    i = torch.randint(n, size = (1,))\n    xi = X[[i],:]\n    yi = y[i]\n    # make an optimization step -- this is where the update actually happens\n    # now p.w is the new value \n    local_loss = opt.step(xi, yi)\n    scores.append( p.score(X))\n    loss = p.loss(X, y).item()\n    loss_vec.append(loss)\n\nNow to check if the data is linearly separable, we need to check if all the dot products between the weight vector w and feature vector xi are the same signs. This is because if the score and the target vector have opposite signs then the perceptron needs to update and we have not found a perfectly correct answer.\n\nclassification = p.score(X)*y\nclassification.min()\n\ntensor(0.3203)\n\n\nSince our minimum value in classification is 0.0`68 we know that for any value of i, &lt;w,xi&gt; &gt; 0 if y = 1, and thus we have a linearly separable dataset.\nTo be extra sure we can also look at the loss and see if the perceptron converges such that it comes to the right answer and has a loss of 0.\n\nplt.plot(loss_vec, marker='o', linestyle='-')\nplt.title('Loss Graph: Experiment 3')\nplt.xlabel('Step')\nplt.ylabel('Loss')\nplt.show()\nprint(\"final loss: \", loss_vec[len(loss_vec)-1])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfinal loss:  0.0\n\n\nWe see that our loss does indeed eventually go to 0 further indicating our perceptron settled on a hyperplane that perfectly separates the data.\nTherefore, the dataset in this experiment is linearly separable\n\n\n\n\nNow we can look at how a minibatch perceptron performs. Instead of looking at a single point during each iteration, we will look at k randomly selected points. In addition to this change we add a learning rate alpha that changes how much the weights change with each iteration.\nTo do this we should update our grad function. The code for the grad function and the whole minibatch perceptron function is here.\nWith our implmentation of the minibatch perceptron we can canduct a few experiments.\n\n\nWe should first check to see that our minibatch perceptron performs similarly to a regular perceptron when it is only looking at one point (just like a regular perceptron). In this case, k = 1.\nWe will first look at how a minibatch perceptron performs compared to a regular perceptron when the data is linearly separable. To do this we will see if the minibatch perceptron converges to a loss of 0 and look at its loss graph.\n\nfrom perceptronMB import PerceptronMB, PerceptronOptimizerMB\nperceptron_data(n_points = 300, noise = 0.2)\n\n# instantiate a model and an optimizer\np = PerceptronMB() \nopt = PerceptronOptimizerMB(p)\n\nloss = 1.0\n\n# for keeping track of loss values\nloss_vec = []\n\nn = X.size()[0]\n\nwhile loss &gt; 0: # dangerous -- only terminates if data is linearly separable\n    # not part of the update: just for tracking our progress  \n    loss = p.loss(X, y) \n    loss_vec.append(loss)  \n    \n    # get k points - code provided by Professor Phil Chodrow\n    k = 1\n    ix = torch.randperm(X.size(0))[:k]\n    xi = X[ix,:]\n    yi = y[ix]\n    \n    # perform a perceptron update using the random data point\n    opt.step(xi, yi)\n    \n    if(loss == 0):\n        print(loss)\n\nloss_graph(loss_vec=loss_vec)\n\ntensor(0.)\nfinal loss:  tensor(0.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt takes more steps, but we do find that the perceptron converges to a loss of 0.\nNow let’s look at how the minibatch perceptron performs with overlapping data.\n\nX, y = perceptron_data(noise=0.5)\n\n# instantiate a model and an optimizer\np = PerceptronMB() \nopt = PerceptronOptimizerMB(p)\n\nloss = 1.0\n\n# for keeping track of loss values\nloss_vec = []\n\niterations = 0\nwhile iterations &lt; 1000: \n    # not part of the update: just for tracking our progress  \n    loss = p.loss(X, y).item()\n    loss_vec.append(loss)\n    \n    # get k points - code provided by Professor Phil Chodrow\n    k = 1\n    ix = torch.randperm(X.size(0))[:k]\n    xi = X[ix,:]\n    yi = y[ix]\n    \n    # perform a perceptron update using the random data point\n    opt.step(xi, yi)\n    \n    if(loss == 0):\n        print(loss)\n        \n    iterations += 1\n\nloss_graph(loss_vec=loss_vec)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfinal loss:  0.08666666597127914\n\n\nAfter 1000 iterations we see that just like the regular perceptron, the minibatch perceptron struggles a little bit but still finds a hyperplane with a low loss.\n\n\n\n\nNow looking at 5 dimensional data where k=10, we should also find that the minibatch perceptron finds a separating line.\n\nfrom perceptronMB import PerceptronMB, PerceptronOptimizerMB\nX, y = multi_dim_perceptron_data(n_points = 300, noise = 0.2, dim=5)\n\n# instantiate a model and an optimizer\np = PerceptronMB() \nopt = PerceptronOptimizerMB(p)\n\nloss = 1.0\n\n# for keeping track of loss values\nloss_vec = []\n\nn = X.size()[0]\n\nwhile loss &gt; 0: # dangerous -- only terminates if data is linearly separable\n    # not part of the update: just for tracking our progress  \n    loss = p.loss(X, y) \n    loss_vec.append(loss)  \n    \n    # get k points - code provided by Professor Phil Chodrow\n    k = 10\n    ix = torch.randperm(X.size(0))[:k]\n    xi = X[ix,:]\n    yi = y[ix]\n    \n    # perform a perceptron update using the random data point\n    opt.step(xi, yi)\n    \n    if(loss == 0):\n        print(loss)\n\nloss_graph(loss_vec=loss_vec)\n\ntensor(0.)\nfinal loss:  tensor(0.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs expected, the minibatch perceptron does indeed find a separating line.\n\n\nNow what happens if k = n, that is we check the entire data set at once. Even if the data is not linearly separable, our minibatch perceptron should be able to converge.\n\nfrom perceptronMB import PerceptronMB, PerceptronOptimizerMB\nX, y = perceptron_data(n_points = 300, noise = 0.5)\n# instantiate a model and an optimizer\np = PerceptronMB() \nopt = PerceptronOptimizerMB(p)\n\n# for keeping track of loss values\nloss_vec = []\n\nn = X.size()[0]\niterations = 0\nwhile iterations &lt; 1000: # dangerous -- only terminates if data is linearly separable\n    # not part of the update: just for tracking our progress  \n    loss = p.loss(X, y).item()\n    loss_vec.append(loss)  \n    \n    # get k points - code provided by Professor Phil Chodrow\n    k = n\n    ix = torch.randperm(X.size(0))[:k]\n    xi = X[ix,:]\n    yi = y[ix]\n    \n    # perform a perceptron update using the random data point\n    opt.step(xi, yi)\n        \n    iterations += 1\n\nloss_graph(loss_vec=loss_vec)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfinal loss:  0.07666666805744171\n\n\nWe see that our loss converges to around 0.07, which is pretty small, even though the data is not linearly separable.\n\n\n\n\nThe runtime complexity of a single iteration is O(N) where N is the number of features (the size of a single row in the feature matrix) This is because the number of computations that occur in a single iteration depends on the dot product between w and Xi where X is the feature matrix and i is a single row in the matrix.\nThe minibatch is essentially the same but instead of looking at just one row of the feature matrix, you are looking at k rows in a single iteration. So the runtime becomes O(KN) where K is the number of rows you are looking at in a single iteration.\nPerceptron grad works by computing the score for a single data point (the dot product between the weight and all the features of the data point). If the score multiplied by the target is below 0 then we have misclassified and our weight is not perfectly accurate. If this is true then we want to multiply Xi * yi to get how much we should change the weight by for each feature (we end up adding this value to our weight in our step function). If we don’t misclassify then we are fine and we return a vector of 0s so we don’t change our weight by anything in the step function.\n\n\n\nThe perceptron algorithm works by continuously updating its weight according to on how accurately it classified the data points given to it. Implementing the perceptron and minibatch perceptron gave me a solid foundational understanding of the perceptron’s design as well as situations where it is well suited to separating data and situations where it is disadvantaged. The experiments helped me further understand the perceptron’s performance over linearly separable data, non-linearly separable data, and multi-dimensional data. Further experimentation with the minibatch perceptron helped me understand how it can converge when a regular perceptron can’t like when it looks at all the data points in a single iteration."

We can use the same perceptron_data function from before, but we can instead set it so that the noise is higher.

We will loop through for 1000 iterations. Let’s see what we come up with after 500 and then finally when we finish at 1000 iterations\n\n# Initialize perceptron\np = Perceptron()\nopt = PerceptronOptimizer(p)\np.loss(X, y)\n\nloss_vec = []\n\n# Training loop to 500\niterations = 0\nwhile iterations &lt; 500:\n    i = torch.randint(n, size = (1,))\n    xi = X[[i],:]\n    yi = y[i]\n    local_loss = opt.step(xi, yi)\n    loss = p.loss(X, y).item()\n    iterations += 1\n    loss_vec.append(loss)\n    \n# Plot perceptron after 500 iterations\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 1, figsize = (4, 4))\nax.set(xlim = (-1, 2), ylim = (-1, 2))\nplot_perceptron_data(X, y, ax)\ndraw_line(p.w, x_min = -1, x_max = 2, ax = ax, color = \"black\")\nprint(loss)\n\n0.1666666716337204\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is somewhat accurate, but it’s a stretch to say perfect like in experiment 1.

To do this, we can run our perceptron algorithm on data with 5 features.\nFirst we need to generate perceptron data with 5 features. To do this we need to modify the perceptron_data function that we have been using. We’ll also make the noise 0.35 (which is just the average of the noises from the pervious experiments)\n\ndef multi_dim_perceptron_data(n_points = 300, noise = 0.35, dim=5):\n    \n    y = torch.arange(n_points) &gt;= int(n_points/2)\n    X = y[:, None] + torch.normal(0.0, noise, size = (n_points, dim))\n    X = torch.cat((X, torch.ones((X.shape[0], 1))), 1)\n\n    # convert y from {0, 1} to {-1, 1}\n    y = 2*y - 1\n\n    return X, y\n\nX, y = multi_dim_perceptron_data(dim=5)\n\nWe can look at the score of our perceptron over the training period to help us answer if the data is linearly separable. First we need to run our algorithm.\n\n# rerun perceptron for experiment 3\n# initialize a perceptron \np = Perceptron()\nopt = PerceptronOptimizer(p)\np.loss(X, y)\nloss = 1\nloss_vec = []\nscores = []\nwhile loss &gt; 0:\n    i = torch.randint(n, size = (1,))\n    xi = X[[i],:]\n    yi = y[i]\n    # make an optimization step -- this is where the update actually happens\n    # now p.w is the new value \n    local_loss = opt.step(xi, yi)\n    scores.append( p.score(X))\n    loss = p.loss(X, y).item()\n    loss_vec.append(loss)\n\nNow to check if the data is linearly separable, we need to check if all the dot products between the weight vector w and feature vector xi are the same signs. This is because if the score and the target vector have opposite signs then the perceptron needs to update and we have not found a perfectly correct answer.\n\nclassification = p.score(X)*y\nclassification.min()\n\ntensor(0.3203)\n\n\nSince our minimum value in classification is 0.0`68 we know that for any value of i, &lt;w,xi&gt; &gt; 0 if y = 1, and thus we have a linearly separable dataset.\nTo be extra sure we can also look at the loss and see if the perceptron converges such that it comes to the right answer and has a loss of 0.\n\nplt.plot(loss_vec, marker='o', linestyle='-')\nplt.title('Loss Graph: Experiment 3')\nplt.xlabel('Step')\nplt.ylabel('Loss')\nplt.show()\nprint(\"final loss: \", loss_vec[len(loss_vec)-1])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfinal loss:  0.0\n\n\nWe see that our loss does indeed eventually go to 0 further indicating our perceptron settled on a hyperplane that perfectly separates the data.\nTherefore, the dataset in this experiment is linearly separable"

    "text": "The runtime complexity of a single iteration is O(N) where N is the number of features (the size of a single row in the feature matrix) This is because the number of computations that occur in a single iteration depends on the dot product between w and Xi where X is the feature matrix and i is a single row in the matrix.\nThe minibatch is essentially the same but instead of looking at just one row of the feature matrix, you are looking at k rows in a single iteration. So the runtime becomes O(KN) where K is the number of rows you are looking at in a single iteration.\nPerceptron grad works by computing the score for a single data point (the dot product between the weight and all the features of the data point). If the score multiplied by the target is below 0 then we have misclassified and our weight is not perfectly accurate. If this is true then we want to multiply Xi * yi to get how much we should change the weight by for each feature (we end up adding this value to our weight in our step function). If we don’t misclassify then we are fine and we return a vector of 0s so we don’t change our weight by anything in the step function."

It does this by analyzing and recreating figures 1 and 3 of the paper, as well as further analyzing potential racial disparity between white and black patients with fewer than 5 active chronic illnesses. Like the original study, this blog post finds that the algorithm employed for the purposes of enrolling patients into an intensive care program gives black patients lower risk scores than similar white patients, thus making it so black patients must be sicker than white patients to be enrolled. This disparity likely stems from the algorithm’s reliance on healthcare spending as a indirect measurement for health, since black patients often receive less care than white patients and therefore have lower medical expenditures.\n\n\n\nIn order to replicate this study, we need to use a randomized version of the data provided by the authors of the original study.

The authors decided to plot this to understand if there were racial health disparities conditional on risk score.\n\n# Plotting figure 1 \n\n# get risk scores as percentile\ndf[\"risk_percentile\"] = (df[\"risk_score_t\"].rank(pct=True) * 100).round()\n\n# get mean number of chronic illnesses and store in new dataframe\ndf['mean_num_CI'] = df.groupby(['risk_percentile', 'race'])['gagne_sum_t'].transform('mean')\n\n# plotting\nfig, axs = plt.subplots(1,1)\naxs.set_title(\"Risk Score vs Number of Chronic Illnesses\")\naxs.set_xlabel(\"Algorithm Risk Score Percentile\")\naxs.set_ylabel(\"Mean Num of Chronic Illnesses\")\nsns.scatterplot(ax = axs,data=df,x='risk_percentile',y='mean_num_CI', hue='race')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis plot shows us that there is indeed a racial disparity between the algorithm’s risk score and the number of chronic illnesses a patient might have. We can see that black patients often have a higher number of chronic illnesses compared to white patients in the same risk score percentile. This means that if Patient A is Black, Patient B is White, and both patients have the exact same number of chronic illnesses, Patient A will likely receive a higher risk score from the algorithm and thus be more likely to be referred to the care management program.\n\n\n\nWe can now look at reproducing figure 3 of the study which compared the mean total medical expenditure to percentile of the algorithm’s risk score as well as the mean total medical expenditure to the number of chronic illnesses a patient had. The authors decided to plot these comparisons to determine if there was any racial disparity in cost for healthcare and as a way to check if there was any disparity in the amount of care received between black and white patients.\n\n# Plotting Figure 3\n\n# get risk percentile\ndf['risk_percentile'] = (df['risk_score_t'].rank(pct=True)*100).round()\n\n# get mean expenditure\ndf[\"cost_by_RS\"] = df.groupby(['risk_percentile','race'])['cost_t'].transform('mean')\n\n# get mean cost of patient healthcare by number of chronic illness\ndf[\"cost_by_CI\"] = df.groupby(['gagne_sum_t','race'])['cost_t'].transform('mean')\n\n# plotting\nfig, axs = plt.subplots(1,2)\naxs[0].set_yscale('log')\naxs[0].set_xlabel(\"Algorithm Risk Score Percentile\")\naxs[0].set_ylabel(\"Mean Total Medical Expenditure\")\naxs[1].set_yscale('log')\naxs[1].set_xlabel(\"Number of Chronic Illnesses\")\naxs[1].set_ylabel(\" \")\nsns.scatterplot(ax=axs[0],data=df,x='risk_percentile',y='cost_by_RS', hue='race')\nsns.scatterplot(ax=axs[1],data=df,x='gagne_sum_t',y='cost_by_CI', hue='race')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese plots show us that as the number of chronic illnesses increase or as your risk score increases, the higher the cost of healthcare is for a patient. This is not particularly surprising since those with higher risk scores are generally less healthy and patients with more chronic illnesses will have higher care needs. However, it is important to note that these plots still show potential evidence of a racial disparity. Most patients have 5 or fewer chronic illnesses and we see that white patients tend to have higher costs than black patients if they have 5 or fewer chronic illnesses. We also see this trend reflected when comparing our risk score and medical expenditure. We find that white patients with lower risk scores tend to have higher healthcare expenditures than black patients. This phenomenon might point to potential racial bias in access to healthcare, where white patients with lower risk scores receive more treatment or care and in turn have higher medical expenditures.\n\n\n\nWe can now try and quantify the disparity we just observed in patients that have 5 or fewer active chronic conditions.\n\n\nTo do so, we need to first determine the percentage of patients with 5 or fewer chronic conditions. If this percentage is small, it might not be worth focusing on these patients.\n\n# Determining percentage of patients with 5 or fewer active chronic conditions\npercentage = len(df.loc[df['gagne_sum_t'] &lt;= 5])/ len(df) * 100\npercentage\n\n95.53952115447689\n\n\n95.5% of patients have five or fewer active chronic conditions, so it does indeed make sense to focus on these patients since any racial disparities occurring within this subgroup of patients will be affecting an overwhelming majority of the people receiving healthcare.\nBecause medical costs can vary by orders of magnitude, we will want to look at the logorithm of the cost. However, in order to do this we also need to drop any patients who did not have any medical cost at all since log(0) is undefined.\n\n# Log-transform of cost\ndf_transform = (df.loc[df['cost_t'] &gt; 0]).copy()\ndf_transform['log_cost'] = np.log(df_transform['cost_t'])\n\nIt might also make it easier for us to do some modeling by creating a one-hot encoded column for the qualitative race variable. For us 1 means the patient is black and 0 means they are white.\nThen we will separate the data into predictor variables X and target variables Y. Our predictor variables are race and the number of active chronic conditions.\n\n# one-hot encoding of race\ndf_transform['race_binary'] = (df_transform['race'] == 'black') * 1\n\n# separation of data into predictor variables and target variables\ndf_X = df_transform[['race_binary','gagne_sum_t']]\ndf_y = df_transform['log_cost']\n\n\n\n\nWith our data prepped, we can now employ a linear regression model. However, our relationship is non-linear, so we will add polynomial features to our model. If we are going to do this, we must also determine how many polynomial features we will use. We can do this with some cross validation. For our purposes we will look from degree 1 to 20.\n\ndef add_polynomial_features(X, degree):\n  X_ = X.copy()\n  for j in range(1, degree):\n    X_[f\"poly_{j}\"] = X_[\"gagne_sum_t\"]**j\n  return X_\n\nLR = LinearRegression()\nscores = []\nfor i in range(20):\n  X_poly = add_polynomial_features(df_X,i)\n  #LR.fit(X_poly, df_y)\n  cross_valscore = cross_val_score(LR, X_poly, df_y)\n  score = (f\"degree {i+1}\",cross_valscore.mean())\n  scores.append(score) \n\nscores.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])\nscores\n\n[('degree 19', 0.10908769701215384),\n ('degree 20', 0.10940809669337344),\n ('degree 18', 0.1193285359520339),\n ('degree 17', 0.12852193502774437),\n ('degree 16', 0.1442007114428923),\n ('degree 3', 0.14537952700038775),\n ('degree 1', 0.14538846793594346),\n ('degree 2', 0.14538846793594346),\n ('degree 5', 0.146909632661908),\n ('degree 4', 0.14699336604386143),\n ('degree 6', 0.1473340656385787),\n ('degree 7', 0.14776094174784324),\n ('degree 15', 0.148069648494553),\n ('degree 8', 0.1480739986116853),\n ('degree 9', 0.14811660549076067),\n ('degree 10', 0.14820529985520275),\n ('degree 12', 0.14824297239083922),\n ('degree 13', 0.1482567134543757),\n ('degree 14', 0.14828133604468716),\n ('degree 11', 0.14830062340213399)]\n\n\nDegree 11 seems to have the highest score, so we will use that. Now we will run our model\n\n# final model\nnew_LR = LinearRegression()\nnew_df_X = add_polynomial_features(df_X, 11)\nnew_LR.fit(new_df_X, df_y)\n\nprint(new_df_X.columns)\nnew_LR.coef_\n\nIndex(['race_binary', 'gagne_sum_t', 'poly_1', 'poly_2', 'poly_3', 'poly_4',\n       'poly_5', 'poly_6', 'poly_7', 'poly_8', 'poly_9', 'poly_10'],\n      dtype='object')\n\n\narray([-2.66958964e-01,  6.12454343e-01,  6.12451935e-01, -1.49609200e+00,\n        9.79709805e-01, -3.45158893e-01,  7.23069132e-02, -9.40470735e-03,\n        7.65069325e-04, -3.78086925e-05,  1.03681896e-06, -1.20918699e-08])\n\n\nWe see that our race coefficient is the first column of our X and therefore is the first coefficient in our linear regression. Now we calculate our wb.\n\nwb = np.exp(new_LR.coef_[0])\nwb\n\n0.7657044921324225\n\n\nAfter running our model, we find that the cost incurred by black patients is about 76.5% that of white patients when considering patients with 5 or fewer chronic conditions. This finding supports the argument of Obermeyer et al. that black patients generate lower costs because they might not receive healthcare due to racial biases.\n\n\n\n\nLike the original study, I found that there exists a racial bias in this algorithm. Black patients with the same risk score as white patients often have lower risk scores, making it harder for them to be enrolled into an intensive care program. This disparity occurs because the algorithm uses healthcare spending as a proxy for health, but black patients often have lower healthcare costs because they have less access to healthcare. Therefore, like the journal article, we find evidence of racial disparity in the algorithm.\nThe algorithm fails the test of sufficiency outlined in the formal statistical discrimination criteria discussed by Barocas, Hardt, and Narayanan (2023). Sufficiency seeks to determine if we will get a certain outcome given a certain prediction. However, the algorithm very clearly gives different outcomes dependent on race, with black patients being more sick than white patients with the same risk score. THe algorithm might predict a black patient to not be qualified for the program, but a white patient will be, while indeed both might actually need to be enrolled. The algorithm could also fail a test of independence since the proxy variable (healthcare costs) affects the score, but healthcare costs are influenced by race and thus the score could be as well."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Like the original study, I found that there exists a racial bias in this algorithm. Black patients with the same risk score as white patients often have lower risk scores, making it harder for them to be enrolled into an intensive care program. This disparity occurs because the algorithm uses healthcare spending as a proxy for health, but black patients often have lower healthcare costs because they have less access to healthcare. Therefore, like the journal article, we find evidence of racial disparity in the algorithm.\nThe algorithm fails the test of sufficiency outlined in the formal statistical discrimination criteria discussed by Barocas, Hardt, and Narayanan (2023). Sufficiency seeks to determine if we will get a certain outcome given a certain prediction. However, the algorithm very clearly gives different outcomes dependent on race, with black patients being more sick than white patients with the same risk score. THe algorithm might predict a black patient to not be qualified for the program, but a white patient will be, while indeed both might actually need to be enrolled. The algorithm could also fail a test of independence since the proxy variable (healthcare costs) affects the score, but healthcare costs are influenced by race and thus the score could be as well."

Comparing the different features in the Palmer penguin data set, it was determined that the culmen length, culmen depth, and island are useful features for determining a penguin’s species. Different types of classification models were also compared (logistic regress, decision tree, and SVC).

Since there are no values outside the diagonal of the matrix, we don’t have any false predictions. Given that we use island as a feature, we will probably see more errors predicting Adelie penguins as Chinstrap or Gentoo. This is because the Adelie penguin is the only penguin species that is present on every island so it is probably easiest for our model to confuse it for another species.\n\n\n\nA logistic regression model trained by looking at the Palmer penguin dataset features of culmen length, culmen depth, and home island was highly accurate, getting an accuracy score of %100 on the test data.\nBy finding this model, I learned about the importance of conducting thorough research on your data. Much of the initial work did not involve creating models but exploring the features and characteristics of the dataset. Only after this exploration was I able to develop an intuition for what features might be useful in creating a model. However, just exploring the data is not enough to create a good model, cross-validation and eliminating features with low variance were also important techniques employed in this process, guiding against overfitting and helping narrow down on useful features respectively."

    "text": "Discussion\nUltimately, I found that the threshold score was 0.53 and that the model was able to earn $7697437.56 in profit. I also found that the model tended to favor higher income individuals and was slightly biased against younger borrowers and borrowers seeking credit for medical reasons. We find that even with a simple formula for calculating bank profits, we were able to generate a large profit for the bank. From the bank’s perspective, I believe that the model satisfies a test of sufficiency since it seems that the the features the model looks at like loan intent and income level are relevant to whether someone will repay their loan. This seems fair from the bank’s perspective because things like medical debt are riskier to repay and thus should be harder to get approved. However, from the borrower’s perspective, this could be seen as unfair since people need to access credit for tremendous medical costs and it is not really their fault that they must get these treatments, so they are punished for something out of their control when they try to access credit. From this we see that what is fair and reasonable from one perspective may not be from another. With this in mind, one could argue that the model both satisfies and fails a narrow view of fairness since the bank might argue that with all things being equal - people are likely to get the same score. Meanwhile, a borrower might argue that loan-intent is not really a feature that should be used since people who are similar in every way except loan intent will probably receive different scores. It all from which perspective you evaluate the model and who you ask. I personally believe in a broader view of fairness that takes into account the implications of the model on the individual borrower and not just the bank. For this reason, I believe that the bank’s model is not fair since people will need to access credit for medical loans and they are unfairly punished for having such a need. Medical loan borrowers can’t control the fact that they need credit for medical expenses and thus should not be punished for it.\nFinally, I learned how to choose an optimal threshold for my model as well as how to investigate the results of that decision."

The Newton Optimizer is a second-order optimization algorithm that uses the Hessian matrix to find the optimal weights for the logistic regression model. We will implement the Newton Optimizer by adding to our previous implementation of logistic regression test it on a simple dataset to ensure that it behaves correctly. These experiments will include determining if the Newton Optimizer converges to the optimal weights giving a small alpha and if it converges faster than the Gradient Descent Optimizer.

Compute loss L costs C units. 2. Compute gradient G costs 2C units. 3. Compute Hessian H costs pc units. 4. Inverting pxp matrix is \\(k_1p^\\gamma\\) units 5. Multiplying by hessian = \\(k_2p^\\gamma\\)\nWe also assume that Newton’s method converges to an adequate solution in \\(t_\\mathrm{nm}\\) steps and standard gradient descent converges in \\(t_\\mathrm{gd}\\) steps.\nNow to calculate the cost of Newton’s method:\nsingle step cost: (2c + pc + \\(k_1p^\\gamma\\) + $ \\(k_2p^\\gamma\\))\nsum costs: c + \\(t_\\mathrm{nm}\\) + (2c + pc + \\(k_1p^\\gamma\\) + $ \\(k_2p^\\gamma\\))\nNow to calculate the cost of standard method:\nsingle step cost: c\nsum costs: c + \\(t_\\mathrm{gd}\\) x 2c\nWith these costs calculated, we can compare the two methods. It seems that generally, Newton’s method is more computationally expensive, but to compare we can create an inequality where the standard gradient descent cost is more than the newton method cost:\nO(standard) &gt; O(newton)\nc + \\(t_\\mathrm{gd}\\) x 2c &gt; c + \\(t_\\mathrm{nm}\\) + (2c + pc + \\(k_1p^\\gamma\\) + $ \\(k_2p^\\gamma\\))\nwith some simplification, we get\n\\(t_\\mathrm{gd}\\) &gt; \\(t_\\mathrm{nm}\\) * (1 + p/2 + \\(k_1p^\\gamma\\)/2c + \\(k_2p^\\gamma\\)/2c)\nSo in order for Newton’s method to be more computationally efficient, the above inequality must hold and \\(t_\\mathrm{gd}\\) must be larger than \\(t_\\mathrm{nm}\\) by a factor of (1 + p/2 + \\(k_1p^\\gamma\\)/2c + \\(k_2p^\\gamma\\)/2c)\nIf p became very large, Newton’s method would not every pay off since there are factors affecting the computational cost of the Newton Method that are dependent on, and grow polynomially with p. This means the cost of Newton’s method grows significantly when p or \\(\\gamma\\) increases. With larger problems, standard gradient descent is probably a better optimization choice.\n\n\n\nIn this blog post, I implemented Newton’s method for optimization and conducted a variety of experiments that tested its behavior. We saw that with a small enough alpha, Newton’s method can converge, but that it takes a very specific set of circumstances (namely that Newton’s alpha be very large and standard gradient descent’s alpha be much smaller) for it to converge faster than standard gradient descent. We also saw that when Newton’s alpha is too large, the model does not converge. Finally, we calculated the computation cost of Newton’s method and found that it is generally more computationally expensive than standard gradient descent, but that it can be more efficient in certain, rare, scenarios."

With larger problems, standard gradient descent is probably a better optimization choice."

    "text": "Jamie Hackney, Mihir Singh, Jake Gilbert\n\n\nThis project seeks to develop, implement, and evaluate various machine learning models to accurately predict refugee population movements in Somalia as part of the United Nations Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Machine Learning Challenge. The data used by our models’ was collected by the UNHCR between 2015 and 2024 in Somalia. It contains information on population movements, markets, health, conflicts, and climate. We developed a web scraper to collect this data and combine it all into a single dataframe. To deal with missing data values, we created two datasets, one by dropping the missing values and the other by imputing them. Then, we built a Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest model on different subsets of these two datasets. We tested these models to see how accurately they could predict the number of refugee arrivals into a specific district in Somalia by computing the root mean squared error (RMSE), framing it as a regression problem. We found that the models had, on average, very high root mean squared errors (indicating a poor fit on the data), yet also had high R2 values (indicating a good fit on the data). We believe this discrepancy is explained by the fact that there are several very large outliers present in the data. To validate this, we binned the predictions into the three severity levels proposed by the UN, and treated it as a classification problem. When doing so, our best model, a Decision Tree Regressor trained on a subset of the dataset where missing features were dropped, achieved an accuracy of 99.5%. This model was also able to perfectly predict the exact number of arrivals 98% of the time, further supporting our hypothesis that these models fit the data very well and the high RMSE is explained by the existence of several large outliers.\n\n\n\nThe intended users of our project are the Somalian government and other NGOs that support refugees in the area. However, our project deals directly with people, as we are predicting where we expect refugees to move in Somalia. Because of this, the entire population of refugees in Somalia could potentially be affected by our project, if it were to be used by any of these agencies or governments to inform resource allocations. Both refugees in Somalia and the groups that support these refugees stand to benefit from our project, assuming the models are an effective tool. If this is the case, then these agencies can better allocate resources, which will benefit the refugees themselves as they will have access to more resources. Additionally, the government and agencies supporting them will benefit from more efficient resource movement. Conversely, if our models prove to be inaccurate enough that they cause resources to be misallocated, both refugees and the groups supporting them could be seriously harmed. Additionally, we note the possibility that bad actors could co-opt these models to predict refugee movements for malicious purposes.\nWe chose to work on this project because we were interested in the intersection between machine learning and public policy. When we found the UN challenge related to this project, we became very interested in the cause of this project, and found the ability to help refugees and their support groups compelling. Assuming that our models are an effective tool for helping agencies allocate resources for refugees, we believe that the benefits to refugee populations and their support groups will bring some relief to that region.\n\n\n\nOur program addresses the humanitarian crisis in Somalia related to refugee movements and forcibly displaced people. The ability to accurately predict patterns in forcibly displaced peoples movements is crucial to the development of public policies that provide aid and resources to refugees. This is not a novel problem, and in fact has been approached several times before. Suleimenova et al., Gulden et al., and Lin et al. all developed agent based models to predict population movements. Gleick investigated the relationship between water and conflict in Syria, drawing a connection between water scarcity and conflicts, which in turn can drive population movements. Finally, Finnley noted an increase in migration of women and children during the severe drought of 1983-1985.\nWe focused on building models trained on a variety of data, including climate, conflicts, and market prices. By looking at a variety of conditions affecting human movement, we predict the movement patterns of displaced people in Somalia. The goal of this project is to effectively predict these population movements so that agencies supporting refugee populations in this area can better allocate resources to regions that are expected to receive a high number of migrants.\n\n\n\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom models import dropNA\nfrom models import impute\nfrom models import evaluate_LR\nfrom models import evaluate_DT\nfrom models import evaluate_RF\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor\n\n\n\nAll of our data came from the Food Security and Nutrition Analysis Unit Dashboard for Somalia (FSNAU). This organization collects data related to food and security in Somalia. FSNAU provides access to this data through a public facing dashboard. Users can select what data they would like to look at and which time frames (in six month increments).\nFor our data, focused on creating two datasets, one where we drop missing values and one where we impute them. Within these datasets, we further split them into all available features, and just the top nine features as recommended by the UNHCR in their previous work with this data (project Jetson). Due to data availability, we focused on data from 2015 - 2024.\n\n# load data\ndf = pd.read_csv('data/combined_data.csv')\n\n/var/folders/fv/_v7myjl904983sbb39qbkzw40000gn/T/ipykernel_98185/3933340257.py:2: DtypeWarning: Columns (17,23) have mixed types. Specify dtype option on import or set low_memory=False.\n  df = pd.read_csv('data/combined_data.csv')\n\n\n\n\n\nThe goal of our models was to predict the number of refugees arriving in a certain district in Somalia. We used the “Arrivals” column of our data as the target feature for our models to predict. For training features, we either trained our models on all features available on the FSNAU dashboard, or the nine features recommended by the UNHCR (region, district, month, year, rainfall, number of conflict fatalities, number of conflict incidents, water price, and goat price). We chose to run models trained on these nine features because the UN found these particularly helpful when building their own machine learning models (Jetson Data). For all models, we dropped the feature describing the number of departures because such data can only be collected after the fact. That is, at the time this model would be run in a “real” scenario, there would be no way of knowing the number of departures in a district for the entire month; a month must first pass for this data to become known. Finally, we split the data into train and test groups, with 80% of the data in the train split and 20% of the data in the test split. Depending on the dataset used, the exact number of rows varied, but for the dataset we found to be best (dropping missing values and only using the nine best features), we had 51,812 train rows and 12,953 test rows.\n\n# create four dataframes of the data\ndf_dropna = dropNA(df)\ndf_dropna_t9 = dropNA(df, top_9=True)\ndf_impute = impute(df)\ndf_impute_t9 = impute(df, top_9=True)\n\n/Users/mihirsingh/anaconda3/envs/ml-0451/lib/python3.9/site-packages/sklearn/impute/_iterative.py:796: ConvergenceWarning: [IterativeImputer] Early stopping criterion not reached.\n  warnings.warn(\n/Users/mihirsingh/anaconda3/envs/ml-0451/lib/python3.9/site-packages/sklearn/impute/_iterative.py:796: ConvergenceWarning: [IterativeImputer] Early stopping criterion not reached.\n  warnings.warn(\n\n\nWe trained a Linear Regression model, Decision Tree Regressor, and Random Forest Regressor model from Sci-Kit Learn to make our predictions. These models were chosen because predicting the number of refugees arriving is a regression problem, where we want our model to give us an estimate of the number of arrivals in a district. We trained each model on the four datasets we created: drop missing values and use all features, drop missing values and use only the best nine features, impute missing values and use all features, and impute missing values and use only the nine best features. The reason for choosing to both impute and drop missing values is to determine the best approach to deal with these missing values, of which there were many. In fact, out of the 328,856 available rows, only 230 had no missing values. A single missing value in any one feature can render the entire row obsolete in training or testing. The benefit of imputing the data is that we end up with much more data to train and test with, potentially increasing accuracy and decreasing the possibility of overfitting. The drawback is that the data is generally lower quality, as many values are estimates not actual observations. Dropping missing values, on the other hand, leads to a smaller dataset, potentially decreasing accuracy and increasing the possibility of overfitting. The data we are left with, however, is much higher quality since it is composed entirely of actual observations.\nThe four datasets that result from this process, as well as their sizes are below:\n\ndf_dropna includes all rows without a single Na or NaN in any feature.\n\ntrain size: 230 x 23\ntest size: 55 x 23\n\ndf_dropna_t9 includes all rows without a single Na or NaN in any of the top nine features.\n\ntrain size: 51,812 x 10\ntest size: 12,953 x 10\n\ndf_impute includes all rows and features and fills in missing values by estimating their value using SciKitLearn’s SimpleImputer.\n\ntrain size: 263084 x 23\ntest size: 65,772 x 23\n\ndf_impute_t9 includes all rows and only the best nine features, and fills in missing values by estimating their value using SciKitLearn’s SimpleImputer.\n\ntrain size: 263084 x 10\ntest size: 65,772 x 10\n\n\nThe disadvantage of imputing the data can be seen in the fact that it produces negative values in the “Arrivals” column, which is impossible.\nWe then evaluated each of the models on each data set using R2, RMSE, and the classification accuracy for the three alarm levels. This classification accuracy came from binning the predictions into one of the three population movement alarm levels set by FSNAU and calculating the percent of times the model predicted the correct alarm level. The reason we included this metric is because the dataset contained several large outliers that heavily skewed the RMSE, which we will go into more at the end of this section. Additionally, we figured that in a real world scenario, it is more likely the aid groups would care more about whether the incoming number of migrants is low, medium, or high, rather than an exact number.\n\n\n\n\nWe evaluate the models using three different metrics, R2, RMSE, and the alarm level classification accuracy. The R2 value measures how well the model explains the observed data values. RMSE measures the average error for a prediction, with the interpretation being that the RMSE value is the average number of people the predictions are off by. Finally, the classification accuracy measures how often the models correctly predict the alarm level. In other words, the classification accuracy is how often the models can correctly predict whether the arrivals will be less than 1000 people, between 1000 and 5000 people, or greater than 5000 people. The tables below show the model performances when evaluated with each of these metrics on the testing data.\n\n\n\n# dropna\nprint(\"Drop Missing Values, Use All Features:\")\ntrain, test =

The 95th percentile of arrivals was 3,701; in other words 90% of arrivales were 3,701 or fewer people. However, the maximum number of arrivals for a single observation was 259,678. This implies the existence of some large outliers in the dataset that skew the RMSE calculation, making the models seem to perform worse than they actually do.\n\nprint(f'90th percentile: \\n{df[\"Arrivals\"].quantile(q=0.95)} \\n')\nprint(f'arrivals statistics: \\n{df[\"Arrivals\"].describe()}')\n\n90th percentile: \n3701.0 \n\narrivals statistics: \ncount    191416.000000\nmean       1226.451807\nstd        5534.244627\nmin           1.000000\n25%          49.000000\n50%         194.000000\n75%         614.000000\nmax      259678.000000\nName: Arrivals, dtype: float64\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen we impute the data, we are filling in the missing values with an estimate based on the other present features. However, when we impute this dataset, we actually end up with some negative values in the arrival column, which is impossible. This can be problematic because it can teach the models to predict negative arrivals, which are impossible observations. We can see that 16% of our imputed data is negative.\n\ndef count_negative(values):\n    count = 0\n    for value in values:\n        if value &lt; 0:\n            count += 1\n    return count\n\nprint(f\"percent of imputed arrival data that is negative: {count_negative(df_impute['Arrivals'])/ len(y_train['Arrivals']) * 100}\")\n\npercent of imputed arrival data that is negative: 16.29023429779082\n\n\n\n\n\nWe created the following visualizations of our data and our best model’s (Decision Tree trained on `df_dropna_t9) predictions.

winter months. This trend seems to hold before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. We also see that there are more arrivals starting from 2017 onwards, this might be due to better data collection, but it is hard to know for sure.\nWe can also visualize how our model does in predicting arrivals. First, we build our best model and calculate the differences between its predictions and the true vales.\n\n# build our best model\ntrain, test = train_test_split(df_dropna_t9, test_size=0.2)\nX_train = train.drop(['Arrivals'], axis=1)\ny_train = train[['Arrivals']]\nX_test = test.drop(['Arrivals'], axis=1)\ny_test = test[['Arrivals']]\n\nDT = DecisionTreeRegressor()\nDT.fit(X_train, y_train)\n\npreds = DT.predict((X_test))\ny_true = y_test.values.flatten()\ndiffs = preds - y_true\n\nWhen we plot a histogram of the differences between our best models predictions and the true values, we can see that the model makes very few significantly wrong predictions (a prediction off by 10 or more people). The plot is on a logarithmic x-axis, to show the number of mispredictions within one order of magnitude. Only mispredictions of 10 people or more are plotted. This supports our hypothesis that the large RMSE is coming from only a few predictions that are very wrong.\n\n# plot only the differences greater than 100\n\nbins = [10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000]\nplt.hist(diffs, bins=bins, edgecolor='black')\nplt.xscale('log')\n\n# Add labels and title\nplt.xlabel('Difference')\nplt.ylabel('Frequency')\nplt.title('Histogram of Differences')\n\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, we can calculate the percent of of the time that the model made a perfect prediction, i.e. predicted the exact number of arrivals. We can see that 98% of the time, the model correctly predicted the exact number of arrivals, further supporting the hypothesis the model is very accurate and the large RMSE comes from a few bad predictions that were very off.\n\nprint(f'percent of perfect predictions: {(np.count_nonzero(diffs == 0) / len(diffs))}')\n\npercent of perfect predictions: 0.9796958233613835"

    "text": "This project seeks to develop, implement, and evaluate various machine learning models to accurately predict refugee population movements in Somalia as part of the United Nations Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Machine Learning Challenge. The data used by our models’ was collected by the UNHCR between 2015 and 2024 in Somalia. It contains information on population movements, markets, health, conflicts, and climate. We developed a web scraper to collect this data and combine it all into a single dataframe. To deal with missing data values, we created two datasets, one by dropping the missing values and the other by imputing them. Then, we built a Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest model on different subsets of these two datasets. We tested these models to see how accurately they could predict the number of refugee arrivals into a specific district in Somalia by computing the root mean squared error (RMSE), framing it as a regression problem. We found that the models had, on average, very high root mean squared errors (indicating a poor fit on the data), yet also had high R2 values (indicating a good fit on the data). We believe this discrepancy is explained by the fact that there are several very large outliers present in the data. To validate this, we binned the predictions into the three severity levels proposed by the UN, and treated it as a classification problem. When doing so, our best model, a Decision Tree Regressor trained on a subset of the dataset where missing features were dropped, achieved an accuracy of 99.5%. This model was also able to perfectly predict the exact number of arrivals 98% of the time, further supporting our hypothesis that these models fit the data very well and the high RMSE is explained by the existence of several large outliers."

    "text": "The intended users of our project are the Somalian government and other NGOs that support refugees in the area. However, our project deals directly with people, as we are predicting where we expect refugees to move in Somalia. Because of this, the entire population of refugees in Somalia could potentially be affected by our project, if it were to be used by any of these agencies or governments to inform resource allocations. Both refugees in Somalia and the groups that support these refugees stand to benefit from our project, assuming the models are an effective tool. If this is the case, then these agencies can better allocate resources, which will benefit the refugees themselves as they will have access to more resources. Additionally, the government and agencies supporting them will benefit from more efficient resource movement. Conversely, if our models prove to be inaccurate enough that they cause resources to be misallocated, both refugees and the groups supporting them could be seriously harmed. Additionally, we note the possibility that bad actors could co-opt these models to predict refugee movements for malicious purposes.\nWe chose to work on this project because we were interested in the intersection between machine learning and public policy. When we found the UN challenge related to this project, we became very interested in the cause of this project, and found the ability to help refugees and their support groups compelling. Assuming that our models are an effective tool for helping agencies allocate resources for refugees, we believe that the benefits to refugee populations and their support groups will bring some relief to that region."

    "text": "Our program addresses the humanitarian crisis in Somalia related to refugee movements and forcibly displaced people. The ability to accurately predict patterns in forcibly displaced peoples movements is crucial to the development of public policies that provide aid and resources to refugees. This is not a novel problem, and in fact has been approached several times before. Suleimenova et al., Gulden et al., and Lin et al. all developed agent based models to predict population movements. Gleick investigated the relationship between water and conflict in Syria, drawing a connection between water scarcity and conflicts, which in turn can drive population movements. Finally, Finnley noted an increase in migration of women and children during the severe drought of 1983-1985.\nWe focused on building models trained on a variety of data, including climate, conflicts, and market prices. By looking at a variety of conditions affecting human movement, we predict the movement patterns of displaced people in Somalia. The goal of this project is to effectively predict these population movements so that agencies supporting refugee populations in this area can better allocate resources to regions that are expected to receive a high number of migrants."

This organization collects data related to food and security in Somalia. FSNAU provides access to this data through a public facing dashboard. Users can select what data they would like to look at and which time frames (in six month increments).\nFor our data, focused on creating two datasets, one where we drop missing values and one where we impute them. Within these datasets, we further split them into all available features, and just the top nine features as recommended by the UNHCR in their previous work with this data (project Jetson). Due to data availability, we focused on data from 2015 - 2024.\n\n# load data\ndf = pd.read_csv('data/combined_data.csv')\n\n/var/folders/fv/_v7myjl904983sbb39qbkzw40000gn/T/ipykernel_98185/3933340257.py:2: DtypeWarning: Columns (17,23) have mixed types. Specify dtype option on import or set low_memory=False.\n  df = pd.read_csv('data/combined_data.csv')\n\n\n\n\n\nThe goal of our models was to predict the number of refugees arriving in a certain district in Somalia. We used the “Arrivals” column of our data as the target feature for our models to predict. For training features, we either trained our models on all features available on the FSNAU dashboard, or the nine features recommended by the UNHCR (region, district, month, year, rainfall, number of conflict fatalities, number of conflict incidents, water price, and goat price). We chose to run models trained on these nine features because the UN found these particularly helpful when building their own machine learning models (Jetson Data). For all models, we dropped the feature describing the number of departures because such data can only be collected after the fact. That is, at the time this model would be run in a “real” scenario, there would be no way of knowing the number of departures in a district for the entire month; a month must first pass for this data to become known. Finally, we split the data into train and test groups, with 80% of the data in the train split and 20% of the data in the test split. Depending on the dataset used, the exact number of rows varied, but for the dataset we found to be best (dropping missing values and only using the nine best features), we had 51,812 train rows and 12,953 test rows.\n\n# create four dataframes of the data\ndf_dropna = dropNA(df)\ndf_dropna_t9 = dropNA(df, top_9=True)\ndf_impute = impute(df)\ndf_impute_t9 = impute(df, top_9=True)\n\n/Users/mihirsingh/anaconda3/envs/ml-0451/lib/python3.9/site-packages/sklearn/impute/_iterative.py:796: ConvergenceWarning: [IterativeImputer] Early stopping criterion not reached.\n  warnings.warn(\n/Users/mihirsingh/anaconda3/envs/ml-0451/lib/python3.9/site-packages/sklearn/impute/_iterative.py:796: ConvergenceWarning: [IterativeImputer] Early stopping criterion not reached.\n  warnings.warn(\n\n\nWe trained a Linear Regression model, Decision Tree Regressor, and Random Forest Regressor model from Sci-Kit Learn to make our predictions. These models were chosen because predicting the number of refugees arriving is a regression problem, where we want our model to give us an estimate of the number of arrivals in a district. We trained each model on the four datasets we created: drop missing values and use all features, drop missing values and use only the best nine features, impute missing values and use all features, and impute missing values and use only the nine best features. The reason for choosing to both impute and drop missing values is to determine the best approach to deal with these missing values, of which there were many. In fact, out of the 328,856 available rows, only 230 had no missing values. A single missing value in any one feature can render the entire row obsolete in training or testing. The benefit of imputing the data is that we end up with much more data to train and test with, potentially increasing accuracy and decreasing the possibility of overfitting. The drawback is that the data is generally lower quality, as many values are estimates not actual observations. Dropping missing values, on the other hand, leads to a smaller dataset, potentially decreasing accuracy and increasing the possibility of overfitting. The data we are left with, however, is much higher quality since it is composed entirely of actual observations.\nThe four datasets that result from this process, as well as their sizes are below:\n\ndf_dropna includes all rows without a single Na or NaN in any feature.\n\ntrain size: 230 x 23\ntest size: 55 x 23\n\ndf_dropna_t9 includes all rows without a single Na or NaN in any of the top nine features.\n\ntrain size: 51,812 x 10\ntest size: 12,953 x 10\n\ndf_impute includes all rows and features and fills in missing values by estimating their value using SciKitLearn’s SimpleImputer.\n\ntrain size: 263084 x 23\ntest size: 65,772 x 23\n\ndf_impute_t9 includes all rows and only the best nine features, and fills in missing values by estimating their value using SciKitLearn’s SimpleImputer.\n\ntrain size: 263084 x 10\ntest size: 65,772 x 10\n\n\nThe disadvantage of imputing the data can be seen in the fact that it produces negative values in the “Arrivals” column, which is impossible.\nWe then evaluated each of the models on each data set using R2, RMSE, and the classification accuracy for the three alarm levels. This classification accuracy came from binning the predictions into one of the three population movement alarm levels set by FSNAU and calculating the percent of times the model predicted the correct alarm level. The reason we included this metric is because the dataset contained several large outliers that heavily skewed the RMSE, which we will go into more at the end of this section. Additionally, we figured that in a real world scenario, it is more likely the aid groups would care more about whether the incoming number of migrants is low, medium, or high, rather than an exact number."

The 95th percentile of arrivals was 3,701; in other words 90% of arrivales were 3,701 or fewer people. However, the maximum number of arrivals for a single observation was 259,678. This implies the existence of some large outliers in the dataset that skew the RMSE calculation, making the models seem to perform worse than they actually do.\n\nprint(f'90th percentile: \\n{df[\"Arrivals\"].quantile(q=0.95)} \\n')\nprint(f'arrivals statistics: \\n{df[\"Arrivals\"].describe()}')\n\n90th percentile: \n3701.0 \n\narrivals statistics: \ncount    191416.000000\nmean       1226.451807\nstd        5534.244627\nmin           1.000000\n25%          49.000000\n50%         194.000000\n75%         614.000000\nmax      259678.000000\nName: Arrivals, dtype: float64\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen we impute the data, we are filling in the missing values with an estimate based on the other present features. However, when we impute this dataset, we actually end up with some negative values in the arrival column, which is impossible. This can be problematic because it can teach the models to predict negative arrivals, which are impossible observations.

winter months. This trend seems to hold before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. We also see that there are more arrivals starting from 2017 onwards, this might be due to better data collection, but it is hard to know for sure.\nWe can also visualize how our model does in predicting arrivals. First, we build our best model and calculate the differences between its predictions and the true vales.\n\n# build our best model\ntrain, test = train_test_split(df_dropna_t9, test_size=0.2)\nX_train = train.drop(['Arrivals'], axis=1)\ny_train = train[['Arrivals']]\nX_test = test.drop(['Arrivals'], axis=1)\ny_test = test[['Arrivals']]\n\nDT = DecisionTreeRegressor()\nDT.fit(X_train, y_train)\n\npreds = DT.predict((X_test))\ny_true = y_test.values.flatten()\ndiffs = preds - y_true\n\nWhen we plot a histogram of the differences between our best models predictions and the true values, we can see that the model makes very few significantly wrong predictions (a prediction off by 10 or more people). The plot is on a logarithmic x-axis, to show the number of mispredictions within one order of magnitude. Only mispredictions of 10 people or more are plotted. This supports our hypothesis that the large RMSE is coming from only a few predictions that are very wrong.\n\n# plot only the differences greater than 100\n\nbins = [10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000]\nplt.hist(diffs, bins=bins, edgecolor='black')\nplt.xscale('log')\n\n# Add labels and title\nplt.xlabel('Difference')\nplt.ylabel('Frequency')\nplt.title('Histogram of Differences')\n\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, we can calculate the percent of of the time that the model made a perfect prediction, i.e. predicted the exact number of arrivals. We can see that 98% of the time, the model correctly predicted the exact number of arrivals, further supporting the hypothesis the model is very accurate and the large RMSE comes from a few bad predictions that were very off.\n\nprint(f'percent of perfect predictions: {(np.count_nonzero(diffs == 0) / len(diffs))}')\n\npercent of perfect predictions: 0.9796958233613835"

However, I primarily spent my time working on the models. This meant finding ways to process our data so that it was usable on logistic regression as well as working on encoding and imputing the data. Jamie and I built the functions to build, train, and evaluate our models in a file called models.py. Here, we had to address multiple issues including figuring out why our score values were so low and deciding what methods of evaluating for accuracy we would use. Do overcome these challenges, we looked out the outliers in our data and found a plausible explanation and created our own evaluation function. I also wrote the code to visualize the number of arrivals and the code to understand the disadvantages of imputing the data. Finally, all three of us worked on the presentation and I mainly wrote the abstract and approach section while working with Jamie on the results section.\n\n\nJamie\nI helped build the web scraper and data aggregator functions in the source code. I helped write some of the code that built and evaluated the models in the blog post as well as visualized the models predictions. I helped write the Values Statement and Introduction, as well as parts of the results and conclusion.\n\n\nJake\nI helped build a web scraper for market data. When we started building the models, I helped work on the ideal way to clean up the data, including imputing and removing NAs. I helped build and expand a few of the early models and expand on Jamie’s original neural network. I helped with the presentation and for our blog, I wrote our results section and our conclusion, drawing upon the data we found."

    "text": "Personal Reflection\nThis project provided me with the opportunity to apply machine learning models like a linear regression, decision tree, and random forests to the socially impactful regression challenge that is predicting the quantity of refugee arrivals in Somalia’s various districts. Throughout this process, I learned how to think strategically about data collection, data preparation, model training, and model evaluation. It was up to our group to determine why our models behaved the way they did, or decide what data we would even look at. Having these opportunities was valuable because they forced me to think about the machine learning process beyond the algorithm. I truly felt like I had ownership over the choices being made and felt that these choices originated from a reasonable decision-making process. Our project was generally pretty successful in its goal of predicting refugee displacement. At first, there were large root mean squared errors and low R squared scores, but we were able to identify that this might be because of some significant outliers in our dataset affecting our RMSE. Our model usually got a perfect prediction 98% of the time, so it was pretty accurate from a regression standpoint. Our model also did well when its predictions were classified into different severity bins matching the same cutoffs used by the UN in the real world. Our best models had a classification accuracy of 99.5%.\nI think I will best remember the process of analyzing our model and conducting experiments to find the best output. We spent lots of time critically examining what went wrong with our initial models and spent lots of time looking at the data to better understand what choices we needed to make to create an accurate model. This practice of thinking strategically about our data and models will be useful in the future for any other machine learning tasks. I am also happy that our project has the potential to have a positive impact on society. I had wanted to explore how machine learning can be used for good since I feel that much of the focus on the ethics in machine learning is spent on how it can harm. While that is very important to consider, I am happy that I got to explore how machine learning might be used as a force for good through this project.\nUltimately, this project gave me insight into what it is like to develop a model from scratch to solve a real-world problem on some real-world data. I will take away the process of thinking critically about the choices we implemented into our code. By working on this project, I developed the ethical awareness, technical skills, and analysis skills required to build an ethical and accurate model."
